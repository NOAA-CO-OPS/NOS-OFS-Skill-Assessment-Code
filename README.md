# National Ocean Service Skill Assessment Code

This repository contains the skill assessment code used by NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) to validate NOS Operational Forecast Systems (OFSs).

## Overview
NOS develops and operates OFS that provide users with nowcast (analyses of near-present) and forecast guidance of water levels, currents, salinity and water
temperature out to a maximum of 120 hours, four times per day. 

OFS are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and will join the NOS' operational oceanographic
capabilities to form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling. Currently, NOS operates a network of 15 OFS
located along the coastal United States. 

The skill assessment code includes Chesapeake Bay OFS (CBOFS) control files for water levels (wl), currents (cu), water temperature (temp), and salinity (salt)
and the results of STEP2, STEP3, STEP6, STEP7, and STEP9 for a currents skill assessment analysis, as an example.
